In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error involves the improper handling of `NSOperation` and `NSOperationQueue`.  Specifically, forgetting to cancel operations when they're no longer needed can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in scenarios with network requests or long-running tasks.  If an operation is canceled mid-execution, resources might not be released properly, potentially causing memory leaks or race conditions.

```objectivec
// Incorrect handling - operation not canceled
NSOperationQueue *queue = [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init];
NSBlockOperation *operation = [NSBlockOperation blockOperationWithBlock:^{    
    // Perform long-running task...
}];
[queue addOperation:operation];
// ... later, the operation is no longer needed, but not canceled

// Correct handling - operation canceled when no longer needed
NSOperationQueue *queue = [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init];
NSBlockOperation *operation = [NSBlockOperation blockOperationWithBlock:^{    
    // Perform long-running task...
}];
[queue addOperation:operation];
// ... later, cancel the operation
[operation cancel];
```
